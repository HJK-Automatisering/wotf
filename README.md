# Workforce of the future (WOTF) - planning tool

This tool is a web application for Erhvervsservice Nord and Ungesekretariatet.\
The purpose of the tool is to generate a visiting plan for teams and local companies participating in the yearly WOTF-event.\
This plan can be exported into an excel document which can be distributed to the teams.

Ideally this tool should be able to autogenerate the visisting plan from given constraints.\
For now one can only manually make a plan.

The platform is hosted [here](https://HJK-Automatisering.github.io/wotf/) via GitHub pages.

This project uses the following tech stack:
- TypeScript (programming language)
- React + Vite (frontend framework)
- Tailwind (css styling)
